reácollection is a piece of software for the creation of objects and products through computational processes. It is a tool for designers to explore the formal and structural properties of different design languages. Due to its generative nature, the software introduces elements of unpredictability. The final objects depends both on the criteria established by the designer and on the algorithm executed by the computer.
